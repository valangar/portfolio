	Hi, <br>
	I am a visualization developer working with <a href="https://www.acumenllc.com/" target="_blank">Acumen, LLC</a> in Burlingame, California for about 2 years.
	<br>
	I enjoy designing visualizations and dashboard solutions and giving them life through the magic of JavaScript code. 
	Before moving to California, I studied Computing (Graphics and Visualization Track) at the <a href = "https://www.utah.edu/" target="_blank">University of Utah</a> and received a Master of Science degree. 
	My liking towards data viz stems from my desire to do two things I have always liked - Computer Science and Art. I like working with pixels and would happily spend hours on them.
	I gain inspiration from the works of <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/" target="_blank">Mike Bostock</a>, <a href="https://www.visualcinnamon.com/" target="_blank">Nadieh Bremer</a>, <a href="http://alignedleft.com/" target="_blank">Scott Murray</a> and many others.
	<br>
	I enjoy adventure, I like going on Hikes, rock climbing (just the indoor kind for now), Kayaking and have recently taken to Skiing! 
	I like animals, so bonus points to you if you have a dog!
	<br>
	I am a relatively new to the professional world and would love to learn more and grow each day; so please feel free to contact me for any questions, suggestions or comments you may have.
